I’m @e5frog

Standard content follows: <br>
I’m interested in electronics, old videogames (70's-90's), particularly System Fairchild (Channel [F]).<br>
I’m currently learning more about Channel F.<br>
I’m looking to collaborate on more games for Channel F.<br>
Check channelf.se, there's current contact information and everything you need to know about Channel F.<br>
